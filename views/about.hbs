<p>This app is developed and maintained by <a href="mailto:dwoodscs@gmail.com">Dave Woods</a> (it's still very much a work in progress!). It is open source, developed primarily with Node.js, Sass, and Handlebars, and it uses resources which are freely available online. All code is available on <a href="https://github.com/dave-woods/woods" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The app is intended to be a small set of microservices and a testing ground for learning back-end programming techniques, and gaining some experience in this area. Please submit any bugs or issues you find to the <a href="https://github.com/dave-woods/woods/issues" target="_blank">GitHub repo issues page</a>.</p>
<p>If you find any part of this site useful, or if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me! Feedback is always appreciated, as I am trying to grow as a developer, and I am happy to talk about the code that I have written for this project.</p>
