<p>POSTing to the <code>/namegen</code> route will produce a JSON response with a random name generated from a list of (at time of writing) 708 <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_codenames">Intel codenames</a> (Try <code>curl -d 'noSpace' {{ urlHost }}/namegen</code>). These can be useful for picking a name for a new project or other random name statistics. By adding <code>noSpace</code> to the POSTed data, you can enforce that no names generated will contain a space character. Generally, the names begin with an uppercase character, and may contain numbers. Please visit the link above to read more about the characteristics of the names.</p>
